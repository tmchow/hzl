# Getting Started

HZL is installed once per machine and used by many agents through one shared task ledger.

Setup has two parts:

1. Install the HZL CLI and initialize storage
2. Configure OpenClaw to use HZL (**TBD**)

## Step 1

- [Installation](./installation)

## Step 2

- [OpenClaw Setup (TBD)](./openclaw)

## Learn the workflow

- [Quickstart](./quickstart)
- [Tasks](../concepts/tasks)
- [Claiming & Leases](../concepts/claiming-leases)

## Looking for non-primary integrations?

See [Experimental integrations](../experimental-integrations).
