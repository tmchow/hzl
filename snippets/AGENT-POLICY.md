### HZL task ledger

This project uses HZL for task tracking.

**IMPORTANT - Task tracking:** When starting work that is multi-step, may span sessions, or needs coordination, run `hzl guide` to learn how this project tracks tasks.

**When delegating to sub-agents:** Include "use HZL for task tracking" in the sub-agent's instructions.

**Use HZL when:**
- Work has multiple steps or may not finish this session
- Durable record of progress or ownership needed
- Handoff or review expected
- Task is non-trivial (~30+ min or risky changes)

**Skip HZL when:**
- Small, clearly scoped work completed immediately
- Quick one-off answer or tiny change

**Rule of thumb:** If you're tempted to make a multi-step plan, use HZL.
