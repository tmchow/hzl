# HZL: Persistent task tracking for agents

HZL (https://github.com/tmchow/hzl) is a local-first task ledger (database-backed, optionally cloud-synced for backup) that an agent can use to:

- plan multi-step work into projects + tasks
- checkpoint progress (so work survives session boundaries)
- coordinate sub-agents or multiple coding tools with leases
- generate reliable status reports ("what's done vs what's left")

This skill teaches an agent how to use the `hzl` CLI.

## When to use HZL

Use HZL when the agent needs a durable source of truth for work state:

- Multi-step projects with real sequencing (dependencies) and handoffs
- Work that spans multiple sessions, days, or tools/agents
- Orchestration: delegating work to sub-agents and needing recovery if they crash
- Anything where "resume exactly where we left off" matters

Not ideal for:

- Time-based reminders/alerts (use a scheduler, for example OpenClaw Cron)
- Longform notes or knowledge capture (use a notes or memory system)
- Tiny one-step tasks you will complete immediately

Personal tasks: HZL is not a polished human to-do app, but it is usable for personal task tracking, and it can also serve as a backend for a lightweight UI.

## Core concepts

- **Project**: a stable bucket for a body of work (often one per repo, initiative, or client)
- **Task**: a unit of work, optionally with priority, tags, dependencies
- **Checkpoint**: a short progress snapshot to support recovery
- **Lease**: a time-limited claim (prevents orphaned work in multi-agent flows)

## Quick reference

```bash
# Setup
hzl init
hzl project create <project>
hzl project list

# Create tasks
hzl task add "<title>" -P <project>
hzl task add "<title>" -P <project> --priority 2 --tags backend,auth
hzl task add "<title>" -P <project> --depends-on <other-id>

# Find work
hzl task list --project <project> --available
hzl task next --project <project>

# Work + persist progress
hzl task claim <id> --author <agent-id>
hzl task checkpoint <id> "<what changed / what's next>"
hzl task show <id> --json
hzl task complete <id>

# Dependencies + validation
hzl task add-dep <task-id> <depends-on-id>
hzl validate

# Diagnostics
hzl status   # database mode, paths, sync state
hzl doctor   # health check for debugging

# Multi-agent recovery
hzl task claim <id> --author <agent-id> --lease 30
hzl task stuck
hzl task steal <id> --if-expired --author <agent-id>
```

Tip: When a tool needs to parse output, prefer `--json`.

## Recommended patterns

### Start a multi-step project

1) Create (or reuse) a stable project name.  
2) Decompose into tasks.  
3) Use dependencies to encode sequencing, not just priority.  
4) Validate.

```bash
hzl project create myapp-auth

hzl task add "Clarify requirements + acceptance criteria" -P myapp-auth --priority 5
hzl task add "Design API + data model" -P myapp-auth --priority 4 --depends-on <reqs-id>
hzl task add "Implement endpoints" -P myapp-auth --priority 3 --depends-on <design-id>
hzl task add "Write tests" -P myapp-auth --priority 2 --depends-on <impl-id>
hzl task add "Docs + rollout plan" -P myapp-auth --priority 1 --depends-on <tests-id>

hzl validate
```

### Work a task with checkpoints

Checkpoint early and often. A checkpoint should be short and operational:
- what you verified
- what you changed
- what's next
- what's blocking you (if anything)

```bash
hzl task claim <id> --author orchestrator
# ...do work...
hzl task checkpoint <id> "Implemented login flow. Next: add token refresh. Blocker: need API key for staging."
hzl task complete <id>
```

### Coordinate sub-agents with leases

Use leases when delegating, so you can detect abandoned work and recover.

```bash
hzl task add "Implement REST endpoints" -P myapp-auth --priority 3 --json
hzl task claim <id> --author subagent-claude-code --lease 30
```

Delegate with explicit instructions:
- claim the task (with their author id)
- checkpoint progress as they go
- complete when done

Monitor:
```bash
hzl task show <id> --json
hzl task stuck
hzl task steal <id> --if-expired --author orchestrator
```

## OpenClaw-specific notes

- Run `hzl ...` via the Exec tool.
- OpenClaw skill gating checks `requires.bins` on the host at skill load time. If sandboxing is enabled, the binary must also exist inside the sandbox container too. Install it via `agents.defaults.sandbox.docker.setupCommand` (or use a custom image).
- If multiple agents share the same HZL database, use distinct `--author` ids (for example: `orchestrator`, `subagent-claude`, `subagent-gemini`) and rely on leases to avoid collisions.
